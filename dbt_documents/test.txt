Tests overview

- They are 2 types of tests
1. Singular tests are SQL queries stored in test are expected to return empty.
2. Build-in tests (Generic test) e.g. unique, nut_null, accepted_values, relationship.

- You can define your own custom generic tests or import tests from dbt package.
- When test is failed, we can use 'cat' command to check the test failed.
  cat + error parth from result
  e.g. cat target/compiled/dbtlearn/models/schema.yml/accepted_values_dim_listings_c_4af51c2452d6f0cd9501f60a32e7fae6.sql
