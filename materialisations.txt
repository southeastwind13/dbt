- When you access the view the underlying select command have to execute then
it doesn't suite for the model that read several times.

2. Table

Remark: 
- Everytime that you rerun the dbt this table will be recreated. (Need a time 
to run for creation)
- It gain advantage after builded then it faster to get transform data.

3. Incremental (Table appends)
